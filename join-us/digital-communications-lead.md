If you’re a communications mage and natural storyteller, capable of delivering a complex narrative in the most impactful way, this could be the gig for you. 

We are building a grassroots movement to create technological alternatives to oppressive systems of societal control. Vehemently anti-censorship, anti-surveillance and anti-authoritarian, we support basic human rights via the creation of opt-in alternatives to traditional power structures.

Working alongside experienced activists, our dream candidate is one who firmly aligns with our political and philosophical ethos. We’re not looking for someone that is just “into crypto/web3” but an individual that lives and breathes cypherpunk ideals and shows a passion for disruption through unconventional means.

- Deep experience in designing and delivering impactful digital communications campaigns validated by use of data and KPIs
- Ability to monitor trends and identify creative opportunities that support campaign objectives
- Demonstrable experience of successfully using social media for campaigning, mobilization, community engagement and/or fundraising
- Good understanding of the political climate and developments in the privacy, data and digital rights, and blockchain space.
- Ability to monitor and analyze performance data.

- Experience working for an open-source organization or an organization aligned politically with Status
- You identify with the cypherpunk movement

### Compensation:

- Expected compensation ranges from $70,000-$100,000 for this role—negotiable for the right candidate
- Payment in any mix of fiat or crypto, with the option to choose the ratio of fiat to crypto on a monthly basis
- A stake in our success via a Status Network Token bonus package

### About Acid.info:

[Acid.info](http://Acid.info) is a creative design studio within Logos. It serves as the organization’s communications hub and is made up of designers, coders, linguists, dreamers and revolutionaries. The department takes a brutalist approach to the creation process, favoring impactful designs over superfluous detail that risks diluting or warping the overall message.  

### About Logos:

Logos emerges from and builds upon the mission undertaken by Status. More overtly political than its predecessor, Logos creates digital infrastructure to emancipate those shut out of global society by oppressive governments, economic circumstances or Big Tech overreach. The collective’s long-term goal is the formation of a network state—a purpose-driven community living within an opt-in alternative system to that of the nation state.
