title: Manifesto

The future is a second enlightenment of the digital world.

The future is people-powered software, geared for liberation.

Acid does not care who you are, anon.

We do not care about your name, gender, race or nationality. In our world idea = idea and the message is the message. Our utopia is private, modular, decentralised, collective, meaningful.

Don’t forget they are lying to you. The human spirit is not dead, the map is not the territory. We are proof of the power born from discovering together: a nomadic war machine in cyberspace, on a mission to create technology that supports freedom, justice and innovation for all.

We believe no one is free until we are all free, because no one is an island: we are all pieces of the main.

If we are your people, [join us](/join-us).

FREE YOUR MIND - 🙂
